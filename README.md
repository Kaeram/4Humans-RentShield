# 4Humans-RentShield
AI-powered tenant dispute resolution platform with evidence verification, DAO governance, and housing transparency.

RentShield is a full-stack platform that enables tenants to anonymously report housing issues, verify evidence using a multimodal AI engine, and resolve disputes through a DAO-based voting system.
The system combines computer vision, EXIF metadata forensics, and LLM reasoning to generate structured case briefs for community jurors while providing public housing transparency via a community heatmap.
